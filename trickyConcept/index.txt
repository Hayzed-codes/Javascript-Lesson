Advantages & Disadvantages of using global variables

Advantages of using global variables
1. You can access the global variables from all the functions in a program
2. It is ideally used for storing constant as it helps to keeps consistency
3. it is useful when multiple functions are accessing the same data

Disadvantages of using global variables
1. Too many variables declared as global, then they remain in the memory till program execution is completed. This can cause out of memory issue
2. It may give unpredictable results in multi-tasking environment
3. If global variables are discontinued, due to code refactoring. You will need to change all the modules where they are called

Advantages Local scope
1. Variables declared/designed inside a function are in the local scope.  
2. Local variables offer a guarantee thhat the variables declared will remain intact while the task is running
3. they are deleted as soon as any function is over and release the memory space which it occupies

Disadvantages
1. They have a very limited scope

Block scope
These are variables that are defined within a block
