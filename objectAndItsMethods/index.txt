BUILT in method is a property that contains a function. it mostly contains function declaration method(). It is a property that contains a function. Function declaration() or Arrow Function()

Object.keys, Object.value, Object.entries, Object,freeze, Object.seal

Object.keys create and return an array containing the keys of an Object

Object.values create and return an array containing the value of an Object

Object.entries creates a nested array of key and value pairs of an Object

Object.freeze prevents modification of existing properties and prevents properties from being added or removed

Object.seal prevents new properties from being addded or removed, but can be edited

we use the delete keyword to delete a property from an object

Adding a function to an object. Only Function expression can be added to a particular object

// Copying primitive values
Javascript will behave as it is expected to behave. you just need to see what was the value of the variable at the time of the assignment

Reference types Object and arrays which are stopped and passed by reference
