Shallow cloning is an object in javascript that creates a new object after copying the top level structure of the original object but not in its nested object or array. In other word, if the original content contains nested object, the shadow clone will create a new reference to those nested objects, rather than create new copies.

Deep clone is an object in javascript. this means creating a new object that is
entirely sepearated from the original object, such that change in the 
new object do not affect the original and vice versa. this will create a new object but nested object will still be reference to the original one
